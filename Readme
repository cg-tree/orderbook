Run cabal repl

run:
(book,trades) = nstep 10 initialState
prices = trades2prices trades


Use runFold to compute the sequence
[f [x0], f [x0,x1] .. f [x0 ..] ]
for example 
  runFold avg prices
will yields a ssequence of running averages
each computed over a larger interval than the last


other noteworthy functions:
dualComp a b x
 a is a function of (b x) and x
 b is a function of x
 so
 === a (b x) x
 this is used to apply the same state to the function that creates orders
 as well as the function that consumes orders see: step

compL composes a list of functions see: nstep
